    "ingredients": [
      "¼ cup low-sodium soy sauce use Tamari for gluten free",
      "¼ cup water",
      "2 tablespoon honey",
      "1 tablespoon brown sugar",
      "1 tablespoon rice vinegar",
      "½ teaspoon toasted sesame oil",
      "2 teaspoon fresh ginger peeled and grated",

    "instructions": "1. In a small bowl or jug, combine the sauce ingredients and give them a quick whisk. Set aside.\n2. In a skillet over medium heat, heat the oil, and cook the chicken (I like to season it with freshly cracked black pepper – optional) and cook for 5 minutes until golden and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet, and set it aside.\n3. Add more oil to the skillet, and saute the vegetables for 3-4 minutes until just softened. Make sure not to cook them for too long, as they'll be cooked for longer with the sauce.\n4. Give the sauce a quick whisk, and add it to the skillet. Cook over low-medium heat for 2-3 minutes until it thickens. If it's thickened too much, add a splash of water to loosen it.\n5. Add the chicken back in and stir to make sure that it's well coated in the sauce. Remove from the stove, and garnish with toasted sesame seeds, and serve over cooked jasmine rice.",

Clean and oil the grilling grate.\n2. Whisk together garlic, rosemary, lemon juice, and olive oil in a large bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer half of mixture to a separate container and set aside. Add chicken to the large bowl and turn pieces to thoroughly coat.\n3. Place chicken directly over the hot side of the grill, cover, and cook, rotating the pieces occasionally (but not flipping them), until the chicken is almost completely cooked through and only a few pink spots remain on the top side, about 4 minutes. Flip chicken and cook on second side until just done, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a serving platter. Re-whisk reserved marinade and pour it over the chicken. Serve immediately.",
